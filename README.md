# TDS-Project-I
**The code is in the Scrape.ipynb file in the same repository. Please consider seeing it once before reviewing the project**

## 1. Process Explanation
  I used Python for data scraping. First, I obtained names of users with >100 followers in Singapore. Next, I fetched user information and stored it in df_final (converted to users.csv). Finally, I fetched the 500 most recent repositories for each user, storing the data in df_repos (converted to repositories.csv).

## 2. Most Intresting Fact
  I have been using Vue.js for a long time but thanks to this project I got to know that it is developed by an independent developer based in Singapore (Evan You) and not some big tech company sitting in Silicon valley (Hey! This was surprising).

## 3. Actionable Insights for Developers
  My analysis showed that the top 5 most used languages are Javascript, Python, Typescript, Java and Go. So,a developer should consider one of these languages for their next project, as they are highly popular and in demand.
